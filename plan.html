                <p>
                    The goal of this website is to promote <strong>100SMILES Dental Care</strong> and increase patient
                    engagement by providing clear information about the clinic and simple ways to get in touch.
                    The site aims to <strong>increase online enquiries and appointment requests by
                        25% within six months</strong> by improving mobile usability, simplifying
                    navigation, and placing clear calls-to-action on every page.
                    and reduce phone calls that ask basic questions such as opening hours and services.

                <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
                <p>Success will be measured by monitoring website analytics and enquiry data over a six-month period.
                    Key performance indicators (KPIs) include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A <strong>25% increase</strong> in contact form submissions and email enquiries compared with
                        the previous six months.</li>
                    <li>A <strong>15-20% reduction</strong> in phone calls asking for basic information such as opening
                        hours and address.</li>
                    <li>An increase in the average time spent on the site to <strong>more than two minutes</strong> per
                        visit.</li>
                    <li>Positive comments from patients about how easy the website is to use when booking appointments.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="audience" class="section">
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>
                    The primary audience includes adults aged <strong>25-55</strong> living in the Razole area,
                    particularly those
                    who are responsible for booking health appointments for their families.
                    The site is also aimed at <strong>families with children under 16</strong> who are looking for a
                    friendly local dentist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The design uses a calm blue-and-white colour scheme, clean layout and friendly imagery to build
                    trust and reduce anxiety
                    about visiting the dentist. Text is written in clear, non-technical language and large headings are
                    used so information
                    can be scanned quickly by busy adults.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="structure" class="section">
                <h2>Site Structure</h2>
                <p>The website consists of five main pages, all linked from a consistent navigation bar on every page:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Home</strong> - Overview of the clinic, key selling points and main calls-to-action.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Services</strong> - Detailed information about treatments, modern technology and current
                        offers.</li>
                    <li><strong>About</strong> - Clinic history, mission, values and staff profiles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Contact</strong> - Location, opening hours, contact details and enquiry form.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plan</strong> - This planning document explaining goals, structure and design decisions.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The navigation menu appears at the top of every page so users can move directly between any two
                    pages at any time.
                    This means all pages are connected to each other through the navigation, not just through the Home
                    page.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="flowchart" class="section">
                <h2>Flowchart</h2>
                <p>The following diagram shows how the main pages link together:</p>
                <img src="Plan.drawio.png"
                    alt="Website structure diagram showing links between Home, Services, About, Contact and Plan"
                    style="max-width:100%;">
                <p>
                    The arrows in the diagram indicate that each page can be accessed from any other page using the
                    site-wide navigation bar,
                    ensuring that visitors are never more than one click away from key information such as services and
                    contact details.
